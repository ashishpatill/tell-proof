# Tell — Agent Orchestration

> How to use **Composer 2.5**, **Opus 4.8**, and **GPT 5.5** with role-specific subagents for a 2-day hackathon build. Priya's user story is the north star — every agent role exists to ship her journey.

---

## Model roles (when to use which)

| Model | Role | Use for | Avoid |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Composer 2.5** (`composer-2.5-fast`) | **Orchestrator + Implementer** | Scaffold wiring, React components, API routes, MCP glue, merge conflicts, milestone execution | Deep prompt engineering, novel detector algorithms |
| **Opus 4.8** (`claude-opus-4-8-thinking-high`) | **Architect + Taste** | Zod contracts, detector logic, taste prompts, reflection validation, edge-case reasoning | Bulk UI boilerplate |
| **GPT 5.5** (`gpt-5.5-medium`) | **UX + Copy + Demo** | User-facing copy, USER_STORY alignment, demo script, landing narrative, voice preset labels | Core TypeScript engine |

**Default session:** Start in **Composer 2.5** with `AGENTS.md` + `@ORCHESTRATION.md`. Escalate to Opus for hard problems; delegate copy/demo to GPT 5.5 subagent.

## Subagents (`.cursor/agents/`)

| Agent | Model hint | Scope | Invoke when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `orchestrator` | Composer 2.5 | Milestones, merges, parallel Task splits | Starting a work session or milestone |
| `core-engineer` | Opus 4.8 | `packages/schema`, `packages/core` | Detectors, fingerprint, capture |
| `taste-engineer` | Opus 4.8 | `packages/taste`, prompts | Taste verdicts, voice parsing |
| `ui-builder` | Composer 2.5 | `apps/web`, components | Tell Report, seam, inspector |
| `ux-copywriter` | GPT 5.5 | Copy, USER_STORY, empty states | Any user-visible string |
| `fixture-smith` | Composer 2.5 | `fixtures/generic-app` | Bland demo app |
| `dogfood-auditor` | Opus 4.8 | Run Tell on self, a11y | Pre-demo, M10 |

Invoke: *"Use the core-engineer subagent to implement SystemFontTell detector"*

## Multitask parallel plan (Day 1)

Run **4 parallel Tasks** from Composer orchestrator after M1 schema is merged:

```
Task 1 [Opus · core-engineer]  → packages/core capture + fingerprint + detectors
Task 2 [Opus · taste-engineer]  → packages/taste mock engine + presets (parallel to core)
Task 3 [Composer · ui-builder]  → apps/web shell + CaptureBar + empty state (Priya copy)
Task 4 [Composer · fixture-smith] → fixtures/generic-app (all planted tells)
```

**Merge gate:** schema frozen → run tasks → vitest on fixture JSON → continue.

## Multitask parallel plan (Day 2)

```
Task 1 [Composer · ui-builder]  → BeforeAfterSeam + TellReport + inspector
Task 2 [Opus · taste-engineer]  → Live Gemini + reflection loop
Task 3 [Composer · orchestrator] → packages/mcp + .cursor/mcp.json smoke test
Task 4 [GPT 5.5 · ux-copywriter] → Landing page + demo script polish
Task 5 [Opus · dogfood-auditor] → M10 zero tells on apps/web
```

## Cursor features checklist

| Feature | Config | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Rules** | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | Role-specific constraints auto-attach by glob |
| **Subagents** | `.cursor/agents/*.md` | Delegate with model-appropriate expertise |
| **MCP** | `.cursor/mcp.json` | `tell_*` tools inside Agent chat |
| **Hooks** | `.cursor/hooks.json` | Session context + token lint on web edits |
| **AGENTS.md** | repo root | Composer reads first every session |
| **CLAUDE.md** | repo root | Claude Code / Project parity |
| **BUILD.md** | repo root | Milestone DoD |
| **USER_STORY.md** | repo root | Priya journey — copy authority for GPT 5.5 |

---

## Prompt templates (paste into Composer)

### Start milestone
```
@ORCHESTRATION.md @BUILD.md @USER_STORY.md
Execute milestone M{N}. Use orchestrator to split parallel Tasks per ORCHESTRATION.md.
Schema is frozen. Do not advance until DoD met.
```

### Opus deep dive
```
Switch to Opus. @packages/core/src/detectors/
Implement {DetectorName} per BUILD.md §5.3. Facts must be deterministic.
Add vitest golden test against fixtures/reports/capture.json.
```

### GPT copy pass
```
Use ux-copywriter subagent (GPT 5.5). @USER_STORY.md copy bank.
Rewrite empty/loading/error states in apps/web for Priya's voice. No emoji. Critic tone.
```

### Pre-demo dogfood
```
Use dogfood-auditor subagent. Run diagnose on apps/web.
Fix any generic tells. Target: zero tells per docs/01_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §12.
```

## Skills to attach manually (Composer session)

| Skill | When |
|---|---|
| `create-rule` | Adding new `.mdc` rules |
| `create-subagent` | New specialized agent |
| `create-hook` | New automation hooks |
| `figma-implement-design` | If Claude Design exports arrive |
| `review-bugbot` | Before milestone merge |
| `vercel-deploy` | Demo deployment (stretch) |

## Cut line reminder

Live URL capture, GitHub repo setup, token reconciliation, and draft-fix diffs are shipped. If something breaks at demo time: fall back to the committed `fixtures/reports/tell-report.json` artifact and the seeded fixture — the offline path still lands Priya's journey.
